# Movie Genre Detection

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify movies into different genres based on textual data, such as movie descriptions or synopses.

## Features

- Text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF for text representation.
- Application of machine learning algorithms for multi-class classification.
- Evaluation of models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `nltk`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-genre-detection.git
   cd movie-genre-detection
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Movie_genre_detection.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train machine learning models for genre classification.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics.

## Dataset

Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and accessible in the working directory. The dataset should include:
- Movie descriptions or synopses.
- Corresponding genre labels for supervised learning.
